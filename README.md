# Broad goals
Simulate a pair of LIF neurons that encode a time-varying signal with [NEURON + Python](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/neuronpython/firststeps.html).

We follow closely section 4.3.3 from "[Neural Engineering](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/neural-engineering)"
by C. Eliasmith and C. H. Anderson.
